/*
 Your Goal: Charity Donation
Let's take all funds that were passed to the receive function and donate them to charity. We'll do this in two steps.

First, modify the constructor to accept a new argument: the charity address.
Next, add a new function called donate. When this function is called transfer all remaining funds in the contract to the charity address.
